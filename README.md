# Swivel Bearing (Fusion 360 CAD Model)

This repository contains a **3D CAD model of a Swivel Bearing** created in **Autodesk Fusion 360**.  
The model is fully parametric and includes **motion animations** to demonstrate how the bearing works.  

##  Features
- Detailed mechanical design of a swivel bearing  
- Parametric dimensions for easy modifications  
- Assembly structure with joints  
- **Animation of rotation and tilt** to visualize the bearing’s functionality  

##  Contents
- `Swivel_Bearing.f3d` → Fusion 360 project file  
- `Export/` → STEP, IGES, and STL exports  
- `Animations/` → short rendered motion clips  

##  Usage
1. Open the `.f3d` file in Autodesk Fusion 360.  
2. Explore the **joints** and **motion study**.  
3. Modify parameters to adjust geometry.  
4. Use exports for 3D printing, simulation, or documentation.
